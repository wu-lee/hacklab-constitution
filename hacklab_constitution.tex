      \item In addition to this main purpose, the Hacklab shall also aspire to:
        \begin{itemize}

          artistic skills and innovation through individual projects,

        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate} % Purpose
  \item Organisation
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item The Hacklab shall be run by its members. A limited set of
      finance, membership and management tasks may be performed by a
      committee on behalf of the members.
    \item All decisions of the Hacklab shall be made by consensus, or
      if consensus cannot be reached then at a meeting by majority
      vote. In this constitution, consensus means that all full
      members have been given the opportunity to object to a decision
      and no reasonable objections have been received within one week.
    \item All members and guests shall refrain from actions or
      behaviour which would have a negative effect on the Hacklab.
    \item The Hacklab shall not be held responsible or liable for
      any actions or behaviour of individuals or groups, whether
      members or guests.
    \item This constitution may only be amended at a general meeting.
    \item In addition to the constitution, the Hacklab shall maintain
      a set of Operating Procedures which shall be amendable by
      consensus decision at any time.
    \item All members and guests shall be bound by both this
      constitution and the current Operating Procedures.
